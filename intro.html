								<h2>The p53 protein</h2>
								<p>The p53 protein plays a critical role in the prevention
								of tumor formation, although it is not required for
								normal cell growth. It can induce cell cycle arrest,
								DNA repair, inhibition of angiogenesis, differentiation,
								or apoptosis in response to oncogenic cellular stress,
								including carcinogen-induced DNA damage, abnormal
								proliferative stimulation, and hypoxia. For
								example, it binds to specific DNA sequences and then
								activates expression of inhibitors of cell cycledependent
								protein kinase complexes such as WAF1
								and GADD45 in response to DNA damage. Expression
								of these proteins causes the cell cycle to stop at the
								G0/G1 phase.</p>
								<p>Inactivation of p53 is considered to be a late event
								involved in the malignant transformation of colorectal
								adenoma to cancer. It involves a two-step mechanism
								consisting of a point mutation in one allele and the loss of another allele, in agreement with Knudson’s
								two-hit hypothesis. Mutations in p53 most probably
								occur within the highly conserved region, exons
								4–8, and renders p53 non-functional. In most cases,
								p53 mutations are associated with a loss of p53’s ability
								to be transactivated not only by the binding of viral
								or endogenous antigens of p53 genes but also by the
								response elements of one or both alleles. On the
								other hand, p53 modulates responsiveness to different
								drugs or treatments.</p>
								<p>Oncogenic activity or loss of tumor suppressor gene
								function resulting from genetic alterations such as
								mutation, insertion, or deletion is prevalent in tumor
								cells and ultimately causes abnormal gene expression.
								The p53 gene, a well-characterized tumor suppressor
								gene, is the most frequently altered gene in human
								cancers, with mutations in approximately 60% of carcinomas
								. It is localized in region p13.1 of chromosome
								17, a region frequently lost in tumor tissues.</p>
								<p>Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been reported as occurring prevalently
								in a wide range of human tumors. Detection of a mutated p53 is thought to provide useful
								information for the clinical management of colorectal neoplasm. In this study, we used
								polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and
								sequencing analysis to rapidly screen for mutations in p53 in colorectal cancer in Taiwan.
								Genomic DNA was purified from colorectal cancer specimens obtained from 80 patients at
								a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. 
								associated with tumor grade, age, or gender (p > 0.05). We found that two-fifths
								of colorectal cancer patients in Taiwan have a p53 mutation, which could be used as a marker
								of colorectal cancer.</p>
								<p> Primer sets were designed to amplify fragments
								within exons 4–8 of p53. We found p53 mutations in 38 of 80 patients. This is the first
								identification of a mutation at codon 143 of p53 in colorectal cancer in Taiwan. In addition,
								we found two insertions in exon 5 of p53. The p53 mutation rate among colorectal tumors
								in Taiwan, found in this study, is 43%. The results indicate that p53 mutation is not significantly.</p>
								<h2>DNA extraction from tumor tissue</h2>
								<p>DNA was extracted using the DNeasyTM Tissue Kit
									(QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the
									manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tumor tissue was
									digested with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K in 400 μl celllysis
									solution for 24 hours at 55ºC until the tissue was
									completely lysed. After adding 200 μl absolute ethanol,
									the mixture was transferred onto the DNeasy minicolumn
									and centrifuged for 1 minute at 8,000 rpm. The
									DNeasy mini-column was washed with the 500 μl
									washing buffer provided in the kit and centrifuged for
									1 minute at 8,000 rpm. Finally, the DNA was eluted
									into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube using 100 μl
									water.</p>
